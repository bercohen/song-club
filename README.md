#About Song-Club
Song-Club is an app I built for musicians to gather and play music with each other. It was inspired by a real group I found in Brooklyn.

#Features
Song-Club allows a **user** to Create **Groups** and **concerts**. 
An owner of a group becomes the **admin** of his group.
Other users can then login and request to join a concert.
The Admin of the paticular group can view all requests to join any of his concerts and determine whether he would like to add the user based on his profile. He may also decline a request.
Logged in users can view the profile of all other users, including name, email, and a link to their music.

#Skills Used
I used **Ruby on Rails** to create the considerably extensive database.
The database consisted of many-to-many relationships of:
	*Users
	*Groups
	*Concerts
	*Performers
	*members

#Future Adittions
*In the future I would like to touch up on some of the user functionality and routing to make the site simpler to use.
*Add some Javascript and styling to make the UX more enjoyable and improve the mobile responsiveness
*Add the ability to upload pictures and videos of concerts that have happened
